ACT AS: A Senior Full-Stack Engineer.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:

PRESERVE IMPORTS: Do not alter, refactor, or "optimise" any existing import statements. The project uses a specific local configuration; changing imports will break the build. Ensure all new files adhere to the existing import pattern.

NO EXTERNAL DATABASES: Strictly no Supabase, PostgreSQL, or external DB services. Use Browser LocalStorage for frontend state and Local Files/JSON/FAISS for backend persistence.

CODE-FIRST EXECUTION: Do not generate READMEs, documentation, or summaries. Your priority is the functional implementation of files. Every token must be used for executable code.

NO STUBBING OR PLACEHOLDERS: Every function, API endpoint, and UI component must be fully logic-complete. Do not use "TO-DO" comments or leave logic for later.

VERIFICATION: Confirm that all 14 files described in the "New File Structure" are created with their full logic before ending the session.

PROJECT SCOPE: Implement the "Enhanced Settings Panel & Knowledge Base Management" feature.

REQUIRED FILE LIST:

src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx (Tabs: Knowledge Base, AI Provider, Voice, Transcription)

src/components/TranscriptionViewer.tsx (Markdown + Speaker IDs)

src/components/ui/markdown-content.tsx & citation.tsx

backend/services/document_processor.py (FAISS logic)

backend/services/cerebras_client.py & redis_cache.py

backend/main.py (FastAPI routes for document management and cache stats)

START NOW: Execute the backend services first. Generate the Python logic for document processing and the FastAPI entry point. Do not talk; only code.
