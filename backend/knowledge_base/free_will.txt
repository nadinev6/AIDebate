# Free Will: Agency, Choice, and Determinism

## Core Definition and Overview

**Free will** in philosophy refers to the capacity of agents to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded. It is the ability to make choices that are genuinely "up to us," implying that we could have chosen otherwise. This concept is central to our understanding of **moral responsibility**, **praise and blame**, **punishment**, and the very nature of **human agency**.

The debate surrounding free will is one of the oldest and most persistent in philosophy, fundamentally questioning whether our actions are truly self-determined or are merely the inevitable outcome of prior causes. This problem arises from the apparent conflict between two deeply held beliefs:
- Our subjective experience of making free choices and being morally responsible.
- The scientific worldview that suggests all events, including human actions, are governed by causal laws.

The core problem of free will can be framed as the tension between **determinism** (the idea that all events are causally necessitated) and our intuitive sense of **freedom**. Different theories attempt to resolve this tension by either denying one of the premises or by arguing that they are compatible.

## Key Historical Figures

**Ancient Foundations**:
- **Aristotle (384-322 BCE)**: Discussed voluntary and involuntary actions, linking voluntariness to moral responsibility.
- **Epicurus (341-270 BCE)**: Introduced the idea of atomic "swerves" to allow for indeterminism and free choice.

**Medieval and Early Modern**:
- **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 CE)**: Grappled with free will in relation to divine foreknowledge and grace.
- **Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)**: Argued for human intellectual freedom as distinct from animal instinct.
- **Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650)**: Posited that the mind (soul) is distinct from the body and capable of free action.
- **Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677)**: Advocated for a strong form of determinism, seeing free will as an illusion stemming from ignorance of causes.
- **John Locke (1632-1704)**: Defined freedom as the power to act or not act according to one's will, but questioned whether the will itself is free.
- **David Hume (1711-1776)**: A prominent compatibilist, arguing that freedom is compatible with necessity (causal determination).

**Modern and Contemporary**:
- **Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)**: Argued for a transcendental freedom necessary for moral agency, distinct from the phenomenal world of cause and effect.
- **William James (1842-1910)**: A strong advocate for libertarian free will, emphasising the feeling of effort in choice.
- **A.J. Ayer (1910-1989)**: A key logical positivist and compatibilist.
- **Harry Frankfurt (1929-)**: Developed influential compatibilist arguments, particularly on "alternative possibilities" and coercion.
- **Peter van Inwagen (1942-)**: A leading incompatibilist, known for the "Consequence Argument."
- **Daniel Dennett (1942-)**: A prominent compatibilist, viewing free will as a complex, evolved capacity.
- **Patricia S. Churchland (1943-)**: A neurophilosopher arguing that neuroscience will inform our understanding of free will.

## Fundamental Principles & Supporting Arguments (Major Theories)

The debate around free will is typically framed by three main positions: Metaphysical Libertarianism, Determinism, and Compatibilism.

### 1. Metaphysical Libertarianism

**Core Claim**: Free will exists and is incompatible with determinism. Agents genuinely have the power to choose between alternative courses of action, meaning that at least some of their choices are not causally determined by prior events.

#### Key Ideas:

**Indeterminism at the Point of Choice**
- At the moment of a free choice, there are genuinely open possibilities. The agent could have chosen differently, even if all prior conditions were exactly the same.
- This indeterminism is often located at the neural level, or in the agent's mental processes, allowing for genuine origination of action.

**Agent Causation**
- Some libertarian theories propose that agents themselves (not just events within them) are irreducible causes of their actions.
- The agent, as a substance or a self, directly initiates a causal chain without being fully determined by prior events or states.

**Intuition of Freedom**
- We have a strong, undeniable subjective experience of making free choices and feeling responsible for them.
- This intuition is often seen as powerful evidence that we are indeed free.

**Moral Responsibility**
- Libertarianism provides a straightforward basis for moral responsibility. If our choices are truly "up to us," then we can legitimately be praised, blamed, or held accountable.
- Without genuine alternative possibilities, moral responsibility seems to vanish.

#### Supporting Arguments:

- **Argument from Experience**: Our daily experience of deliberation and choice strongly suggests that we are free. We feel that we could have chosen otherwise.
- **Argument from Moral Responsibility**: If determinism were true, then no one would truly be morally responsible for their actions, as they could not have done otherwise. This contradicts our fundamental moral practices (e.g., holding criminals accountable, praising heroes).
- **Argument from Deliberation**: The act of deliberating about what to do implies that we believe there are genuine alternative paths open to us. Deliberation would be pointless if our actions were already determined.
- **Quantum Indeterminacy**: Some argue that quantum mechanics, which posits fundamental indeterminacy at the subatomic level, might provide a physical basis for free will, though the link to macroscopic human action is highly contentious.

### 2. Determinism

**Core Claim**: All events, including human actions and choices, are causally necessitated by prior events and the laws of nature. Given the initial conditions of the universe and the laws of physics, everything that happens, including every thought and decision, could not have happened otherwise.

#### Key Ideas:

**Causal Determinism**
- Every event has a cause, and given that cause, the event must occur.
- This applies to mental events
